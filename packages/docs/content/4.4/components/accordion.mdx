## How to use React Accordion component.

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the accordion content.

<Example>
  <CAccordion activeItemKey={2}>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={1}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #1</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={2}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #2</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until
        the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={3}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #3</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until
        the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
  </CAccordion>
</Example>

```jsx
<CAccordion activeItemKey={2}>
  <CAccordionItem itemKey={1}>
    <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #1</CAccordionHeader>
    <CAccordionBody>
      <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the

    </CAccordionBody>
  </CAccordionItem>
  <CAccordionItem itemKey={2}>
    <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #2</CAccordionHeader>
    <CAccordionBody>
      <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
      collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
      control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can

```

### Flush

Add `flush` to remove the default `background-color`, some borders, and some rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

<Example>
  <CAccordion flush>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={1}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #1</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={2}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #2</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until
        the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={3}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #3</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>
    </CAccordionItem>
  </CAccordion>
</Example>

```jsx
<CAccordion flush>
  <CAccordionItem itemKey={1}>
    <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #1</CAccordionHeader>
    <CAccordionBody>

    </CAccordionBody>
  </CAccordionItem>
  <CAccordionItem itemKey={2}>
    <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #2</CAccordionHeader>
    <CAccordionBody>
      <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the

    </CAccordionBody>
  </CAccordionItem>
</CAccordion>
```

### Always open

Add `alwaysOpen` property to make react accordion items stay open when another item is opened.

<Example>
  <CAccordion alwaysOpen activeItemKey={2}>
    <CAccordionItem itemKey={1}>
      <CAccordionHeader>Accordion Item #1</CAccordionHeader>
      <CAccordionBody>
        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the
        collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
        classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
        transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.
        It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the{' '}
        <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
      </CAccordionBody>

```

## Customizing

### CSS variables

React accordions use local CSS variables on `.accordion` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

```sass
--cui-accordion-color: #{color-contrast($accordion-bg)};
--cui-accordion-bg: #{$accordion-bg};
--cui-accordion-transition: #{$accordion-transition};
--cui-accordion-border-color: #{$accordion-border-color};
--cui-accordion-border-width: #{$accordion-border-width};
--cui-accordion-border-radius: #{$accordion-border-radius};
--cui-accordion-inner-border-radius: #{$accordion-inner-border-radius};
--cui-accordion-btn-padding-x: #{$accordion-button-padding-x};
--cui-accordion-btn-padding-y: #{$accordion-button-padding-y};
--cui-accordion-btn-color: #{$accordion-color};
--cui-accordion-btn-bg: #{$accordion-button-bg};
--cui-accordion-btn-icon: #{escape-svg($accordion-button-icon)};
--cui-accordion-btn-icon-width: #{$accordion-icon-width};
--cui-accordion-btn-icon-transform: #{$accordion-icon-transform};
--cui-accordion-btn-icon-transition: #{$accordion-icon-transition};
--cui-accordion-btn-active-icon: #{escape-svg($accordion-button-active-icon)};
--cui-accordion-btn-focus-border-color: #{$accordion-button-focus-border-color};
--cui-accordion-btn-focus-box-shadow: #{$accordion-button-focus-box-shadow};
--cui-accordion-body-padding-x: #{$accordion-body-padding-x};
--cui-accordion-body-padding-y: #{$accordion-body-padding-y};
--cui-accordion-active-color: #{$accordion-button-active-color};
--cui-accordion-active-bg: #{$accordion-button-active-bg};
```

#### How to use CSS variables

```jsx
const vars = { 
  '--my-css-var': 10,
  '--my-another-css-var': "red" 
}
return <CAccordion style={vars}>...</CAccordion>
```

### SASS variables

```sass
$accordion-padding-y:                     1rem;
