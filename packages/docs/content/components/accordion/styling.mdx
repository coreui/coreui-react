### CSS class names

React Accordion comes with built-in class names that make styling super simple. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can use:

<ClassNamesDocs
  files={[
    'components/accordion/CAccordion.tsx',
    'components/accordion/CAccordionBody.tsx',
    'components/accordion/CAccordionItem.tsx',
    'components/accordion/CAccordionHeader.tsx',
  ]}
/>

### CSS variables

React Accordion supports CSS variables for easy customization. These variables are set via SASS but allow direct overrides in your stylesheets or inline styles.

<ScssDocs file="_accordion.scss" capture="accordion-css-vars" />

#### How to use CSS variables

```jsx
const customVars = {
  '--cui-accordion-color': '#333',
  '--cui-accordion-bg': '#f8f9fa',
}

return <CAccordion style={customVars}>{/* Accordion content */}</CAccordion>
```

### SASS variables

<ScssDocs file="_variables.scss" capture="accordion-variables" />
