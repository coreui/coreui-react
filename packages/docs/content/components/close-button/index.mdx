import { CCloseButton } from '@coreui/react/src/index'

## Example

Provide an option to dismiss or close a component with `<CCloseButton>`. Default styling is limited, but highly customizable. Modify the Sass variables to replace the default `background-image`.

```jsx preview
<CCloseButton />
```

## Disabled state

Disabled close buttons change their `opacity`. We've also applied `pointer-events: none` and `user-select: none` to preventing hover and active states from triggering.

```jsx preview
<CCloseButton disabled />
```

## Dark variant

Add `dark` boolean property to the `<CCloseButton>`, to invert the close button. This uses the filter property to invert the background-image without overriding its value.

```jsx preview className="bg-dark border-0"
<CCloseButton dark />
<CCloseButton dark disabled />
```
