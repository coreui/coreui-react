import React400Img from './../../assets/images/react400.jpg'

## Responsive images

Images in CoreUI for React.js are made responsive with `fluid` property. This applies `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

```jsx preview
<CImage fluid src={ReactImg} />
```

## Image thumbnails

In addition to our [border-radius utilities](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/borders), you can use prop`thumbnail` to give an image a rounded 1px border appearance.

```jsx preview
<CImage rounded thumbnail src={React400Img} width={200} height={200} />
```

## Aligning images

Align images with the `align` property.

```jsx preview
<div className="clearfix">
  <CImage align="start" rounded src={React400Img} width={200} height={200} />
  <CImage align="end" rounded src={React400Img} width={200} height={200} />
</div>
```

```jsx preview
<div className="clearfix">
  <CImage align="center" rounded src={React400Img} width={200} height={200} />
</div>
```

```jsx preview
<div className="text-center">
  <CImage rounded src={React400Img} width={200} height={200} />
</div>
```
