## Responsive images

Images in CoreUI for React.js are made responsive with `fluid` property. This applies `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;` to the image so that it scales with the parent element.

<ExampleSnippet2 component="ImageResponsiveExample" componentName="React Image" />

## Image thumbnails

In addition to our [border-radius utilities](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/borders), you can use prop`thumbnail` to give an image a rounded 1px border appearance.

<ExampleSnippet2 component="ImageThumbnailExample" componentName="React Image" />

## Aligning images

Align images with the `align` property.

<ExampleSnippet2 component="ImageAligningExample" componentName="React Image" />

<ExampleSnippet2 component="ImageAligning2Example" componentName="React Image" />

<ExampleSnippet2 component="ImageAligning3Example" componentName="React Image" />
