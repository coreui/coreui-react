{/* ### CSS class names

React Offcanvas comes with built-in class names that make styling super simple. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can use:

<ClassNamesDocs
  files={[
    'components/offcanvas/COffcanvas.tsx',
  ]}
/> */}

### CSS variables

React offcanvas uses local CSS variables on `.offcanvas` for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

<ScssDocs file="_offcanvas.scss" capture="offcanvas-css-vars"/>

#### How to use CSS variables

```jsx
const customVars = {
  '--cui-offcanvas-color': '#555',
  '--cui-offcanvas-bg': '#fff',
}

return <COffcanvas style={customVars}>{/* Offcanvas content */}</COffcanvas>
```

### SASS variables
