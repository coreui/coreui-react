## How to use React Breadcrumb Component.

The react breadcrumb navigation provides links back to each previous page the user navigated through and shows the current location in a website or an application. You don’t have to add separators, because they automatically added in CSS through ::before and content.

<ExampleSnippet component="BreadcrumbExample" componentName="React Breadcrumb" />

## Dividers

Dividers are automatically added in CSS through [`::before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) and [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content). They can be changed by modifying a local CSS custom property `--cui-breadcrumb-divider`, or through the `$breadcrumb-divider` Sass variable — and `$breadcrumb-divider-flipped` for its RTL counterpart, if needed. We default to our Sass variable, which is set as a fallback to the custom property. This way, you get a global divider that you can override without recompiling CSS at any time.

<ExampleSnippet component="BreadcrumbDividersExample" componentName="React Breadcrumb" />

When modifying via Sass, the [quote](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/string#quote) function is required to generate the quotes around a string. For example, using `>` as the divider, you can use this:

```scss
$breadcrumb-divider: quote('>');
```

It's also possible to use an **embedded SVG icon**. Apply it via our CSS custom property, or use the Sass variable.

<ExampleSnippet component="BreadcrumbDividers2Example" componentName="React Breadcrumb" />

```scss
$breadcrumb-divider: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' 
width='8' height='8'%3E%3Cpath d='M2.5 0L1 1.5 3.5 4 1 6.5 2.5 8l4-4-4-4z' fill='currentColor'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
```

You can also remove the divider setting `--cui-breadcrumb-divider: '';` (empty strings in CSS custom properties counts as a value), or setting the Sass variable to `$breadcrumb-divider: none;`.

<ExampleSnippet component="BreadcrumbDividers3Example" componentName="React Breadcrumb" />

```scss
$breadcrumb-divider: none;
```

## Accessibility

Since react breadcrumbs provide navigation, it's useful to add a significant label such as `aria-label="breadcrumb"` to explain the type of navigation implemented in the `<nav>` element. You should also add an `aria-current="page"` to the last item of the set to show that it represents the current page. **CoreUI for React.js automatically add all of this labels to breadcrumb's components.**
