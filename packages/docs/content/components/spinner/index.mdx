## About

CoreUI "spinners" can be used to show the loading state in your projects. They're built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don't need any JavaScript to create them. You will, however, need some custom JavaScript to toggle their visibility. Their appearance, alignment, and sizing can be easily customized with our amazing utility classes.

For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes `role="status"` and a nested `<span className="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>`.

## Border spinner

Use the border spinners for a lightweight loading indicator.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner/>
```

### Colors

The border spinner uses `currentColor` for its `border-color`. You can use any of our text color utilities on the standard spinner.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner color="primary" />
<CSpinner color="secondary" />
<CSpinner color="success" />
<CSpinner color="danger" />
<CSpinner color="warning" />
<CSpinner color="info" />
<CSpinner color="light" />
<CSpinner color="dark" />
```

## Growing spinner

If you don't fancy a border spinner, switch to the grow spinner. While it doesn't technically spin, it does repeatedly grow!

```jsx preview
<CSpinner variant="grow" />
```

Once again, this spinner is built with `currentColor`, so you can easily change its appearance. Here it is in blue, along with the supported variants.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner color="primary" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="secondary" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="success" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="danger" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="warning" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="info" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="light" variant="grow" />
<CSpinner color="dark" variant="grow" />
```

## Alignment 

CoreUI React spinners are built with `rems`, `currentColor`, and `display: inline-flex`. This means they can easily be resized, recolored, and quickly aligned.

### Margin 

Use [margin utilities](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/spacing/#margin-and-padding) like `.m-5` for easy spacing.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner className="m-5" />
```

### Placement

Use [flexbox utilities](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/flex/), [float utilities](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/float/), or [text alignment](https://coreui.io/docs/utilities/text/) utilities to place spinners exactly where you need them in any situation.

#### Flex

```jsx preview
<div className="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <CSpinner />
</div>
```

```jsx preview
<div className="d-flex align-items-center">
  <strong role="status">Loading...</strong>
  <CSpinner className="ms-auto" />
</div>
```

#### Floats

```jsx preview
<div className="clearfix">
  <CSpinner className="float-end" />
</div>
```

#### Text align

```jsx preview
<div className="text-center">
  <CSpinner />
</div>
```

## Size

Add `size="sm"` property to make a smaller spinner that can quickly be used within other components.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner size="sm" />
<CSpinner size="sm" variant="grow" />
```

Or, use custom CSS or inline styles to change the dimensions as needed.

```jsx preview
<CSpinner size="sm" style={{ width: '3rem', height: '3rem'}}/>
<CSpinner size="sm" variant="grow" style={{ width: '3rem', height: '3rem'}}/>
```

## Buttons

Use spinners within buttons to indicate an action is currently processing or taking place. You may also swap the text out of the spinner element and utilize button text as needed.

```jsx preview
<CButton color="primary" disabled>
  <CSpinner as="span" size="sm" aria-hidden="true" />
</CButton>
<CButton color="primary" disabled>
  <CSpinner as="span" size="sm" aria-hidden="true" />
  Loading...
</CButton>
```

```jsx preview
<CButton color="primary" disabled>
  <CSpinner as="span" size="sm" variant="grow" aria-hidden="true" />
</CButton>
<CButton color="primary" disabled>
  <CSpinner as="span" size="sm" variant="grow" aria-hidden="true" />
  Loading...
</CButton>
```
