## Examples

Callout component is prepared for any length of text, as well as an optional elements like icons, headings, etc. For a styling, use one of the **required** contextual props (e.g., `color="success"`).

import { CalloutExample } from './examples/CalloutExample.tsx'
import CalloutExampleTS from '!!raw-loader!./examples/CalloutExample.tsx'

<ExampleSnippet code={CalloutExampleTS} componentName="React Callout">
  <CalloutExample />
</ExampleSnippet>

<Callout color="info" title="Conveying meaning to assistive technologies">
  Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to
  users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the
  color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through
  alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.visually-hidden` class.
</Callout>
