## Overview

We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily scalableâ€”all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping `<nav>` element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.

In addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it's advisable to provide a descriptive `aria-label` for the `<nav>` to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be `aria-label="Search results pages"`.

## Working with icons

Looking to use an icon or symbol in place of text for some pagination links? Be sure to provide proper screen reader support with `aria` attributes.

## Disabled and active states

Pagination links are customizable for different circumstances. Use `disabled` for links that appear un-clickable and `.active` to indicate the current page.

While the `disabled` prop uses `pointer-events: none` to _try_ to disable the link functionality of `<a>`s, that CSS property is not yet standardized and doesn't account for keyboard navigation. As such, we always add `tabindex="-1"` on disabled links and use custom JavaScript to fully disable their functionality.

## Sizing

Fancy larger or smaller pagination? Add `size="lg"` or `size="sm"` for additional sizes.

## Alignment

Change the alignment of pagination components with `align` property.
