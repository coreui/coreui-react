### CSS variables

CoreUI for React components use local CSS variables for validation for enhanced real-time customization. Values for the CSS variables are set via Sass, so Sass customization is still supported, too.

<ScssDocs file="_root.scss" capture="root-form-validation-variables" />

These variables are also color mode adaptive, meaning they change color while in dark mode.

### SASS variables

<ScssDocs file="_variables.scss" capture="form-feedback-variables" />

<ScssDocs file="_variables.scss" capture="form-validation-colors" />

<ScssDocs file="_variables-dark.scss" capture="form-validation-colors-dark" />
