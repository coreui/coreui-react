## Forms

Every group of form fields should reside in a `<CForm>` element. CoreUI provides no default styling for the `<CForm>` element, but there are some powerful browser features that are provided by default.

- New to browser forms? Consider reviewing [the MDN form docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) for an overview and complete list of available attributes.
- `<CButton>`s within a `<CForm>` default to `type="submit"`, so strive to be specific and always include a `type`.
- You can disable every form element within a form with the `disabled` attribute on the `<CForm>`.

Since CoreUI applies `display: block` and `width: 100%` to almost all our form controls, forms will by default stack vertically. Additional classes can be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis.

## Utilities

[Margin utilities](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/utilities/spacing/) are the easiest way to add some structure to forms. They provide basic grouping of labels, controls, optional form text, and form validation messaging. We recommend sticking to `margin-bottom` utilities, and using a single direction throughout the form for consistency.

## Form grid

More complex forms can be built using our grid classes. Use these for form layouts that require multiple columns, varied widths, and additional alignment options.

## Gutters

By adding [gutter modifier classes](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/layout/gutters/), you can have control over the gutter width in as well the inline as block direction.

More complex layouts can also be created with the grid system.

## Horizontal form

Create horizontal forms with the grid by adding the `.row` class to form groups and using the `.col-*-*` classes to specify the width of your labels and controls. Be sure to add `.col-form-label` to your `<CFormLabel>`s as well so they're vertically centered with their associated form controls.

At times, you maybe need to use margin or padding utilities to create that perfect alignment you need. For example, we've removed the `padding-top` on our stacked radio inputs label to better align the text baseline.

### Horizontal form label sizing

Be sure to use `.col-form-label-sm` or `.col-form-label-lg` to your `<CFormLabel>`s or `<legend>`s to correctly follow the size of `.form-control-lg` and `.form-control-sm`.

<ExampleSnippet component="LayoutHorizontalFormLabelSizingExample" componentName="React Form Layout" />

## Column sizing

As shown in the previous examples, our grid system allows you to place any number of `<CCol>`s within a `<CRow>`. They'll split the available width equally between them. You may also pick a subset of your columns to take up more or less space, while the remaining `<CCol>`s equally split the rest, with specific column classes like `<CCol sm={7} >`.

<ExampleSnippet component="LayoutColumnSizingExample" componentName="React Form Layout" />

## Auto-sizing

The example below uses a flexbox utility to vertically center the contents and changes `<CCol>` to `<CCol xs="auto">` so that your columns only take up as much space as needed. Put another way, the column sizes itself based on the contents.

<ExampleSnippet component="LayoutAutoSizingExample" componentName="React Form Layout" />

You can then remix that once again with size-specific column classes.

<ExampleSnippet component="LayoutAutoSizing2Example" componentName="React Form Layout" />

## Inline forms

Use the `<CCol xs="auto">` class to create horizontal layouts. By adding [gutter modifier classes](https://coreui.io/bootstrap/docs/layout/gutters/), we will have gutters in horizontal and vertical directions. The `.align-items-center` aligns the form elements to the middle, making the `<CFormCheck>` align properly.
